## 🧠 AI-Accelerated Development: Insights \& Professional Prompts

A significant portion of the project was developed using advanced AI coding assistants and prompt engineering. Below are examples of actual prompts, demonstrating the professional rigor applied throughout development.

**Initial Component Design**
> “Generate a responsive React component for a pricing section using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The component should accept an array of plan objects. Each plan has a name, price, description, and feature list. If a plan is ‘popular’, add a visual gradient border and badge. Include a toggle for monthly/yearly pricing with smooth price transition animation. Animate appearance of cards using Framer Motion (stagger in on scroll).”

**Animation Polish**
> “Refine the PricingSection. On hover, cards should animate using a 3D rotateY and translateZ effect. The ‘popular’ plan should emit floating particles using Framer Motion. Call-to-action button on hover gets a sweeping shine effect. Animate checkmarks on the features list sliding in from the left, using cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) transitions.”

**Responsiveness \& Accessibility**
> “Ensure all components in `/components` are fully responsive. Implement a hamburger menu that animates into a full-screen overlay on mobile. The HeroSection should switch between single-column (mobile) and two-column (desktop) grids, using Tailwind responsive utilities for adaptive spacing and typography.”

**3D Graphics Integration**
> “Integrate a Spline-generated 3D scene into a React Hero component, with a loading spinner until the asset is ready. Enable interactive object animation triggered by scroll position or hover using Spline’s API.”

## 🌐 AI vs Manual Work Split

| Category | % of Work | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AI-Generated | 65% | Initial UI scaffolding, animation logic, utilities |
| Manual Coding \& Integration | 20% | File structure, Next.js config, content, Spline integration |
| Customization \& Refinement | 15% | Bug-fixing, accessibility, animation tweaking, fine-tuning |
